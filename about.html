                        <span class="bold">I used to be a pack rat.</span> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

                        <span class="bold">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</span> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.

                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

                        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
